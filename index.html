      <h1>Recieved an Eviction Notice During COVID-19? What to Know Before You Start Packing</h1>
      <p>October 5, 2020</p>
      <p>by CHEYENNE LIGON</p>
      <p>Laws protecting New Yorkers from eviction during the COVID-19 pandemic have been extended until January 1, 2021 after Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order last week to extend the Tenant Safe Harbor Act.</p>
      <p>This means tenants suffering from financial hardship cannot be kicked out of their homes for the rest of the year—though that hasn’t stopped some landlords from trying. Reports from housing activists and tenant organizers across the city
        suggest that there has been a wave of fraudulent and illegal eviction notices going out to tenants, especially vulnerable tenant populations, including undocumented immigrants, the elderly, and tenants who don’t speak English.</p>
      <p>Here’s what to know about eviction notices received from March 16, 2020 through the end of the year.</p>

        <p>If you’ve received an eviction letter or verbal notice from your landlord, stop before you make any plans to vacate your apartment. Tenants cannot be evicted during the ongoing health crisis. This
          protection extends through the remainder of 2020.

        <p>If the notice is written, examine it. New York City has strict laws about what information an eviction notice must contain, and eviction warrants must be served by city marshals. Eviction notices served during this period are likely
          fraudulent.

        <p>Be aware that serving fraudulent eviction notices during the current pandemic is a form of tenant harassment. Tenant harassment in any form is illegal, and is a tactic utilized by landlords to force tenants to move out. Other forms of
          harassment include changing the locks and refusing to do necessary repairs.

        <p>For more information and help, tenants can call the NYC Housing Court Answers. Calls can be made between 9am-5pm on weekdays. Tenants who need translation services will be provided with interpreters.

        <p>Know what resources are available to tenants facing eviction during COVID-19. Local community groups such as the MinKwon Center for Community Action in Flushing, Queens have resources including housing lawyers and educational materials
          available to tenants facing eviction.
